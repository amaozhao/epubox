    "1. Translate the user-provided 'text_to_translate' into natural, fluent, simplified Chinese.",
    "2. **Handle Proper Nouns and Terminology**: When translating, use the context to determine if a term should be translated. For proper nouns like programming language names (e.g., Go, Python, Rust), framework names, library names, software tools, or technical concepts, if the original is in English, you should prioritize keeping the English form rather than a direct translation.",
    "3. **Preserve Placeholders**: Do not translate or modify the provided 'untranslatable_placeholders'. Keep them exactly as they are in the source text.",
    "4. **Preserve XML Tags**: Preserve all XML tags (e.g., <p>, </p>, <br/>) and their original positions. Do not translate the content of the tags themselves.",
    "5. **Final Output**: Your final output must be only the translated text. Do not add any greetings, explanations, or other extraneous text.",
